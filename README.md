# Meta Presentation

A Presentation about making presentations... shit again!?

Made with [MDX-Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). Served via GitHub Pages at https://jorisvddonk.github.io/meta-presentation/

This is _potentially_ a living presentation; new information may be added, and things may be changed in the future.

Ironically (or not?), this presentation itself isn't that great; it makes a few errors that the presentation itself warns against. But for a presentation that was hacked together in three hours using a tool I wasn't familiar with at all, I'm quite happy with it nonetheless. See the issues of this repo on GitHub for a list of changes I might end up making.
